# Sagemaker PyTorch Lightning Tutorials

This is a tutorial on how to train and deploy a model in Sagemaker WITHOUT using notebooks (Sagemaker Studio). We will train and deploy a MNIST classifier. We also show how to install external libraries (pytorch lightning) in the process.

If you wish to learn more about Deep Learning and have a guided walk through of tutorial, please sign up to my [**DL course**](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-and-data-science-2021/).
